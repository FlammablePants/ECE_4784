Phase 1 of Engineering Electrophysiology

This matlab code is a model of a cell membrane and its channel conductances in response to injected currents.
To use, download the code and run it. You will be prompted to enter the amplitude and duration of the injected current.
Enter the injected current parameters desired and the membrane voltage and conductances will be plotted.
